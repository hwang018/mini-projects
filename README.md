# mini-projects

to generate randomized 2D matrix, for pathfinding
design:
params:
m x n rectangle shaped matrix
start point, end point
intensity level of obstacles
guaranteed path/paths

obstacles represented by 1 no obstacle is 0

functions required:
    f -> generate guaranteed path
    f -> generate grids
    f -> apply generated guaranteed path onto grids (sweep out)
